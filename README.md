# pinyin pronunciation quiz

I'm thinking about writing a script to practice pronouncing all the syllables in Mandarin, but for now I'm just practicing a few from character names in [a novel I'm reading](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Civil_Servant_s_Notebook/5tNOdz3imvUC?hl=en) so I pronounce the character names correctly in my head as I read.
